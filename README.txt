Ising Model (Magnet Simulation) - 3rd Year Theoretical Physics Project.
The code in this repository simulates a spin lattice under the Ising Model assumptions.
This is a probabilistic model predicting the magnetization of a material under certain temperatures (and other conditions).
Points of discontinuity in resulting graphs predict a phase change, showing that this simple model is capable of capturing the undelying physical phenomena.
